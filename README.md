# hello-world
This is my first repository

I like writing code - everything from SQL to web development. I am still learning and am still trying to find my niche, but I tend to lean more towards back-end development and writing/improving algorithms. Hence, I'm attracted more to startup companies because of the degree of freedom they generally give to developers in developing their own new ideas.

The languages and IDEs I have the most practice/experience in are C# and ASP.NET (in Visual Studio), Java (in Eclipse), SQL (MySQL), and MATLAB. I am also very familiar with other scripting languages like Python, Ruby, and Powershell, as well as  Mathematica, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, among others.

I've worked in software development before (using C# and the ASP.NET framework, as well as SQL, JavaScript, and CSS) and am familiar with things like source control and building, merging, and branching code. 

Also, moon tacos.
